### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
The journey of a 1000 miles begins with the first git add ., git commit -m and git push origin master.

Don't be afraid to suck at something new, because the more you do it...The easier it becomes. 

I'm working on RESTful APIs, SOAP, and some Spring Boot MVC and in my spare time 
I'm taking a look at C#, ASP.Net and am trying to build as many websites in MVC as I can.<br>


Angular, React and Reactive Native are in my sites. <br>
