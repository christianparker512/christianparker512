### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


ðŸ”­Hello. I'm a former educator who decided to pivot careerwise during the pandemic. I enrolled and finished a coding bootcamp and am looking for that first unique opportunity to start the next chapter of my professional career.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#, ASP.Net and am trying to build as many websites in MVC as I can.<br>


ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding a great place to work.<br>
